# Healthcare Analytics Project

This repository hosts the **Healthcare** project, a Jupyter notebook–based analysis pipeline for healthcare data. The main notebook (`Healthcare.ipynb`) walks through data ingestion, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and visualization.

## Project Overview

This project is intended to provide a reproducible workflow for analyzing healthcare datasets. The notebook demonstrates:

- Reading and cleaning raw data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Visualizations and interpretation of results  

Through this pipeline, the goal is to derive actionable insights from healthcare data, e.g. predicting outcomes, identifying trends, and supporting decision-making in a healthcare context.

## Features / Highlights

Some key features demonstrated in this project:

- Data cleaning routines (handling missing values, normalization, encoding)  
- Exploratory visualizations to uncover distributions, correlations, and outliers  
- Machine learning model training and evaluation  
- Interpretability (e.g. feature importance, model diagnostics)  
- Clear organization and reproducibility

## Data

> **Note**: As of this writing, the repository does **not** include raw data files. You’ll need to supply your own data to run the notebook.

- The notebook expects input datasets (e.g. CSVs) in a structured format (rows = observations, columns = features + target).  
- You may need to adjust file paths or data schema depending on your dataset.  
- It is assumed that sensitive or private patient data is handled with care and in compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g. HIPAA).
