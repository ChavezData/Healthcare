Healthcare Analytics Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled Healthcare.ipynb, which explores healthcare-related data for analysis and modeling. The purpose is to perform data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling of key healthcare metrics.

🧭 Project Overview

In this notebook you will find:
	•	Loading of a healthcare dataset (patient demographics, medical and health factors)
	•	Data cleaning and preparation (handling missing values, data types, feature engineering)
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns
	•	Visualization of key variables (age, BMI, sex, region, medical costs, etc.)
	•	Building predictive models (e.g., regression or classification) to estimate healthcare costs or outcomes based on those features
	•	Interpretation of results and some discussion of what the findings could imply for healthcare decision-making

🔧 Technologies & Libraries

The notebook uses Python and standard data-science libraries, including:
	•	pandas for data manipulation
	•	numpy for numerical operations
	•	matplotlib and/or seaborn for visualizations
	•	scikit-learn (or similar) for model building
	•	Jupyter Notebook environment for interactive exploration

🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Healthcare.git


	2.	Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended)
	3.	Install required packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter


	4.	Launch Jupyter Notebook, open Healthcare.ipynb, and run the cells in sequence

jupyter notebook



📝 How to Use / Walk-Through
	•	Step 1: Inspect the data – load the dataset, view sample rows, understand the features.
	•	Step 2: Clean and preprocess – handle missing values, convert data types, engineer new features if needed.
	•	Step 3: Explore via EDA – visualize distributions of age, BMI, sex, region; examine correlations with cost/outcome.
	•	Step 4: Model building – define a target variable (e.g., healthcare cost), select features, split into train/test, fit model(s), evaluate performance.
	•	Step 5: Interpret and conclude – what do the model results tell us? Which features are important? What insights for healthcare stakeholders?

🎯 Potential Extensions

Here are some ideas if you’d like to expand the project:
	•	Use additional data sources (e.g., regional healthcare statistics, insurance claims)
	•	Try more advanced modeling (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks)
	•	Perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction
	•	Create an interactive dashboard (using Plotly Dash or Streamlit) for stakeholders
	•	Investigate fairness or bias in healthcare outcomes across demographic groups
	•	Deploy a model for real-time prediction (e.g., via a web API)
